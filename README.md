<h1>Giftastic! - gif generator

This is an application that pulls random gif images from the GIPHY API.

On initial page load, the app will dynamically build and append a button for each of the default topics. When clicked, up to 10 images of the specified button are displayed.

The images are initially still. When an image is clicked, the gif will animate.

The user can add buttons to the array by entering the information in the search form.
